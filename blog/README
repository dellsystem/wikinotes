To make this work you need to link pagination to your SITE PACKAGES

You can do so with the following command:

sudo ln -s 'pwd'/blog/django-pagination-1.0.5/pagination PATH_TO_SITE_PACKAGES/pagination

In my case that is:
sudo ln -s 'pwd'/blog/django-pagination-1.0.5/pagination /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pagination
